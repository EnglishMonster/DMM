I should read a lot of English materials if I wanna improve my English skills.  
The teacher was eager to learn English, so she reccommended me to read English materials every day.  
But it's hard to me because I have not so much passion on learning English.  
She reccomeneded to read what I am interested in. For example SF, or newspaper.  
It seems to be a way to learn English efficiently.
